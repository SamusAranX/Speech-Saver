Speech-Saver
============

A simplistic Text-to-Speech app for OS X

How to use
----------
Start the .app (you may have to open it right-clicking->Open due to Gatekeeper), write/paste/open stuff and hit "Start speaking"(or press ⌘+↩). 

Clicking "Stop speaking" (or hitting aforementioned shortcut again) will, well, make the app stop speaking. 

Opening a file from the menu (or hitting ⌘+O) will open a file browser asking for either .txt or .rtf files. 

Clicking "Save to File…" (or pressing ⌘+S) will open a save panel, asking you for a path to save an AIFF file with the spoken text to.

Hitting "Voice Options…" (or ⌘+,) will open a drawer containing a few options to play with.

__Note to people interested in the code__: Don't expect quality. This is the first 'real' app I wrote and I'm sure there'll be things in there that'll really grind your gears. You've been warned.

Why

Why not?

I'm currently learning how to use Objective-C while making an iPhone app, and wanted to see whether I could use my knowledge of the language to make an app for OS X. Turns out I could.
